# Angular Project README

## Overview

This repository contains an Angular project that includes components and services. This document provides instructions on running unit tests for a component and a service, along with documentation on executing the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the unit tests or the application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).

## Running Unit Tests

### Component Unit Test

1. **Navigate to Component Directory**: Navigate to the directory containing the component you want to test.

2. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute the following command to run the unit tests for the component.

   ```bash
   ng test
   ```

3. **View Test Results**: Review the test results in the terminal. Ensure that the component's unit tests cover all lines of code.

### Service Unit Test

1. **Navigate to Service Directory**: Navigate to the directory containing the service you want to test.

2. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute the following command to run the unit tests for the service.

   ```bash
   ng test
   ```

3. **View Test Results**: Review the test results in the terminal. Ensure that the service's unit tests cover all lines of code.

### Interpreting Test Results

After running the unit tests, analyze the results to ensure that both the component and service have 100% code coverage. Use the code coverage report generated by Karma to identify any areas where additional tests may be needed.

## Running the Application

To run the Angular application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**: Execute the following command to build and serve the application locally.

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to access the application.

## Conclusion

By following the instructions provided in this README, you can run unit tests for components and services in your Angular project and execute the application locally. Remember to keep your tests up to date as you make changes to your codebase to maintain reliable test coverage.
